### Styled Paragraphs and Sections

When using any of the __SimplyClassyCSS__ styles, text inside special `<span>` tags becomes highlighted. Additionally, special `<p>` tags draw styled boxes around your paragraphs. Very useful for studying, analyzing or creating emphasis on texts. The syntax is:

#### Extra: Automatic styling scripts

The groovy scripts [**SpanHighlighter**](scripts/spanHighlighter.groovy) and [**BoxedParagraph**](scripts/boxedParagraph.groovy) wrap selected text in a `JTextComponent` (Java Swing) with the desired syntax.

To use in freeplane: after setting up the CSS style, install the scripts, select the text youâ€™d like to emphasize, and call the desired script: the appropriate tags will be inserted automatically. A brief explanation on how to use each script:

__Freeplane Tip!__ You can use the [**SpanHighlighter**](scripts/spanHighlighter.groovy) script to ___automatically surround the text you'd like to highlight___ with `<span class="...">my_text</span>`. The default is yellow. You can change the color simply by changing the `class` attribute. The script gets installed in the menu `Format -> Highlight -> Span Highlighter`. _Suggestion: for quick access, assign the `ctrl + shift + L` shortcut to the script_.

__Freeplane Tip!__ You can use the [**BoxedParagraph**](scripts/boxedParagraph.groovy) script to ___automatically surround the paragraph you'd like to enclose in a box___ with `<p class="...">my_paragraph</p>`. The default is dotted box. You can change it by modifying the `class` attribute.  The script gets installed in the menu `Format -> Highlight -> Boxed Paragraph`. _Suggestion: for quick access, assign the `ctrl + shift + P` shortcut to the script_.
